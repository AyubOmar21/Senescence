            This is an audiovisual EP that reflects with how we interact with nature in comparison with how AI treats our view of the natural world. What we believe is AI isn't necessarily always correct in terms of how certain aspects of life and environment is viewed. Take nature for example, if you ask AI to think of a forest, it will think of it in a bright mood like the sun shining and stuff. However is a forest like that all the time? in fact most of the time it rains, muddy, broken trees and branches, grey etc. While AI can take this to account once you explain it, it doesn't mean that it's first train of thought. That's what we are trying to accomplish.
